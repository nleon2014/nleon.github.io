						<h2 style="float: left; width: 75%;">Procter & Gamble - Maintenance Technician</h2><h2 style="float: right; width: 25%;">Sept 2023 - Present</h2>
						<p>
							Mehoopany, PA
						</p>
						<p>
							Procter & Gamble's plant in Mehoopany PA is where I currently work, as a Technician responsible for working with my team to keep the line running at optimal condition to produce diapers. If you've had reason to look at a box of Pampers recently, there's a strong chance I had a hand in making it.
						</p>

						<p>
							This job has demanded a lot of my technical skills, and has drastically improved my mechanical functions. In addition to being responsible for the loading of material to keep the line operational, all technicians on the team are responsible for <u><strong><b>troubleshooting</b></strong></u> the equipment should the line fail.
							<br /><br />There are many complicated and line-specific pieces of hardware inside the line, but we work primarily around <b>optic sensors, motors, pnuematics, FIFEs, probes, HMIs, glue applicators,</b> and of course all the bolts and adhesives that hold it all together.
							Not only working around such, but understanding their use at a foundational level, to the point where if there is an issue on the line, we're able to quickly troubleshoot the source of the problem and see that it gets resolved.
						</p>

						In my position I am responsible for overseeing all of the glues that go into forming the diaper, as well as the areas of machinery that produce what we call the "patch" and "core" of the diaper.
						<b>Quality Control</b> is a heavy focus at P&G, and that falls on my shoulders as well regarding these adhesives. Since my time there, I've also received an accolade for "Best Equipment Owner" for the above mentioned area not just on my line, but across 48 other possible recipients.

						<div class="anchor" id="C3i" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -100px; visibility: hidden;"></div>

						<h2 style="float: left; width: 75%;">C3i Solutions - Hardware / Logistics Technician</h2><h2 style="float: right; width: 25%;">Feb 2020 - Sept 2023</h2>
						<p>
							Pittston, PA
						</p>

						<p>C3i Solutions is a company that provides different medical devices to their clients. While working for them, I held two different positions in both Hardware and Logistics.</p>

						<p>
							As a Hardware Technician, my job was to set up the medical devices purchased according to client specification. For different medical studies, there were different ways in which every device needed to operate under different conditions. I worked with different specific technologies such as oximeters and scales, as well as more common devices like iPads and iPhones.
							<br /><br /><b>Attention to detail</b> was the most important required skill here. An incredibly large order could be turned worthless should a device not be set to exact specifications. Understanding how to read the work orders provided and become more intricately familiar with the devices in question was tantamount, and I received quite a lot of experience in doing so.
						</p>

						<p>
							As a Logistics Technician, I filled a staffing need by working in the warehouse instead. Here our duties instead revolved around receiving the devices into the building. However the amount of care required was absolutely the same.
							I was responsible for logging all new equipment into our database, transferring equipment, staging it for use by the hardware division, the physical storage of such equipment. More than any other skill, my use of <b>Excel</b> had gotten extremely polished at this point, along with the distribution of responsibility in a team setting.
						</p>

						<!-- Sportech -->
						<div class="anchor" id="Sportech" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -100px; visibility: hidden;"></div>

						<h2 style="float: left; width: 75%;">Sportech Industries - Tote Technician</h2><h2 style="float: right; width: 25%;">Aug 2018 - Jan 2021</h2>
						<p>
							Mohegan Sun - Wilkes Barre, PA
						</p>

						<p>
							As part of the Mohegan Sun Casino, I worked for Sportech, the third-party used to run the technical aspects of the racetrack. I was responsible for the maintenance of and the resolution of all issues regarding the sports betting machines used to place wagers on horse races, as well as troubleshoot and fix issues with equipment such as televisions, and different specific hardware involved in the large billboard display on the racetrack.
							<br /><br />
							The most prominent skill in this position revolved around <b>logical problem solving.</b> Most of the issues we faced came from customer reports on a piece of hardware not responding correctly, or a different issue regarding their wager, such as losing their ticket. A very important part of our responsibilities was to <b>parse</b> these customer statements, acknowledge and understand the situation, and use the information at hand to come to an apt solution.
							<br /><br />
							Specific work done in this position involved the repair and replacement of esports betting hardware, along with heavy usage of our database and <b>SQL functions.</b>

						<div class="anchor" id="VR" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -100px; visibility: hidden;"></div>

						<h2 style="float: left; width: 75%;">VR Guest - VR Developer</h2><h2 style="float: right; width: 25%;">Aug 2019 - Feb 2020</h2>
						<p>
							Wilkes-Barre, PA
						</p>

						<p>
							Just after graduating college, I was brought to VR Guest as a Software Developer for VR. I had previous experience in making games in <b>Unity,</b> and that was the primary engine that was being used.
							<br /><br />
							I was asked to create a multitude of different spaces for use on a VR Headset. These were meant to be immersive experiences, specifically for things such as realty, weddings, and most ambitiously for use in a floatation pod.

							<br /><br /><a href="https://vrguest.net/examples/realty/">Click here</a> for a look at a project that I worked on. This is one of the projects developed to show a piece of real-estate through VR, allowing someone to walk through a home without being there. It works just as well on a VR Headset, where you interact with arrows to move from room to room. I built the foundation for this project myself, and it's been used across a variety of locations since then.

							<br /><br />At this job I collaborated with other programmers as well, getting to experience <b>team-coding</b> in a professional settings. There are other examples of these VR tours on their website, but in addition to those, I helped to construct a VR zipline experience with target shooting, and a spectrometer that turned an audio file into a visual display.

						<h2 style="float: left; width: 75%;">Price Chopper - Supervisor</h2><h2 style="float: right; width: 25%;">Apr 2015 - Dec 2019</h2>
						<p>
							Wyoming, PA
						</p>

						<p>
							Price Chopper was the first job that I held, and it served to greatly develop my <b>interpersonal skills</b> with customers. I was hired as a Cashier, and had been promoted to a Supervisor within the year.
							<br /><br />
							As Supervisor, my responsibilities both evolved and stayed the same. The new position did not detract from my responsibilities to be a cashier when necessary, keeping me very much grounded and close-knit with my coworkers. Being Supervisor however meant that I was the first point of contact for customer complaint, I needed to manage front-of-house functionality, and I was very much in a <b>leadership</b> role where I needed to delegate my team appropriately.

					<h3>Major: Mass Communications<br />Minor: Computer Science</h3>
					<p>
						I graduated from King's College in 2019, after the bulk of my education was finished in relation to Computer Science and Programming. However it was at the end of my education where I was given a unique opportunity. Under the Mass Communications umbrella, a track had just opened up specifically around game-design. This was very much a passion of mine, and I thought it to be a great opportunity to get a professional first-look inside of the industry.
						Most notably from my experience in college, I helped to program a robot that performed simple tasks, and also received an award for Excellence in Video Game Design.

						<br /><br />This unique blend of skills allowed me to not only gain a large technical understanding of software and it's inner workings, but also learn the best approaches for channeling communication through different branches that may not be as fluent in the technical aspects. This knowledge allows me to have an extremely capable middle ground of communicating desires, relay what is within possibility, and be a trustworthy reliable resource for actual implementation.
